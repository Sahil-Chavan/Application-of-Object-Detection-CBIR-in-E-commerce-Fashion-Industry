# Application-of-Object-Detection-CBIR-in-E-commerce-Fashion-Industry

- This is my final year project and my thesis for 2 research papers. I and two other teammates developed a complete E-commerce solution incorporating CBIR using Image as a query for buyers and Object Detection and Classifier module for automatic tagging of fashion apparel, benefiting the sellers. 
- Performed robust data augmentation techniques like geometric, color space, and resolution transformations on the scraped data using OpenCV and Pillow. Using libraries like Tensorflow and Pytorch we designed a 256-layer deep CNN and inserted it into an Object Detection algorithm like Faster RCNN and SSD using transfer learning. Trained it on a dual GPU Linux server with 128GB VRAM using SSH remote connection and integrating Jupyter Notebook in it.
- Observing variational strengths in different model combinations, designed a new algorithm to ensemble results from OD multiple models into one superior output in a quadratic weighted function, named ‘Non-linear Maximal Weighted Box Integration ’. It outperforms all singular models as well as other integration techniques.
